# Schedulator : A Planning Schedule Generator

## What is Schedulator?

Schedulator is a new project written by two geeks from the University of Waterloo.

Schedulator takes your deadlines and algorithmically generates study sessions to make sure you get your work done in time.
This deadline can be anything! Exam dates, planning for weddings, or even to set time aside for you to go shopping for groceries. 
Regardless of the task, give us an end date and we will generate a beautiful schedule.

## What if I already have a personal schedule such as gCal or Outlook?

Dont worry! Schedulator has gCal and Outlook authorization to allow us to pull your current events from your calendar, which we use to place the study sessions around the times you already have booked off. 

On top of that, it allows for very simple export to your favourite calendar!

## Is it easy to use?

Extremely. Simply enter a new event/deadline into the "Events Widget" on the Calender page, and we will automatically regenerate the schedule.

## Oh no! My deadline changed. Now what?

Don't worry! Schedulator allows you to edit events as much and as often as you'd like. Whether that's the title, deadline date, or time required, our algorithm will regenerate your schedule upon each request.

## Well, what are you waiting for!
